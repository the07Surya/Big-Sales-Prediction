# Big Sales Prediction
This project focuses on predicting big sales using the Random Forest Regressor model.
The aim is to build an accurate and robust machine learning model that can forecast sales based on historical data and various features such as store size, location, and promotional activities.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Model Training: Implementing the Random Forest Regressor to train on the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Plotting feature importances and sales predictions to understand model behavior.

**Results**
The model predicts sales with a high degree of accuracy, helping businesses make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.
